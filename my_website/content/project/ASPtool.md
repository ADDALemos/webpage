# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Boolean logical models of biological regulatory and signalling networks are increasingly used to formally describe and understand complex biological processes. Such models often need to be repaired whenever new observations become available, rendering the model inconsistent with the new observations. Although many studies have focuses on inferring new models (or classes of models) from data, the automation of model repair is still in its infancy, often still being a manual process and therefore prone to errors. In this work, a tool is provided to suggest possible repair operations to inconsistent models based on changing the model logical functions. The tool uses Answer Set Programming to identify possible repair operations to the models following both synchronous or asynchronous updating schemes. The tool was validated using both Boolean models of randomly generated networks and data sets of Escherichia coli at steady state. The limitations of the implemented tool for each of the updating schemes are discussed. The impact of the minimization algorithm is also addressed."
